This repository contains programming codes relating to two case studies used as case study scenarios: a textile industry and its fabric production (Case Study 1) and a metallurgical industry with heat treatment processes (Case Study 2).

In Case Study 1 (CS1), historical data on machine failures in the textile industry were used, such as type of failure, time of the failure event, repair time, cost, criticality of the failure, temperature and humidity of the environment at the location at the time of the failure event.

In Case Study 2 (CS2) using machine status data collected from heat treatment furnaces in a large industry.

The machines have sensors that collect information about general machine vibration, collision, imbalance, electrical network and bearings 1, 2 and 3.

During the study we had direct contact with experts from the metalworking industry. Technical interviews were carried out, considering that the focus was to understand how data could support decision making and which critical operational scenarios needed to be mapped. The data collected was not made available for confidentiality reasons.
